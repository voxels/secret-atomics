Backing the strips with a rigid material, like cut up strips of window frames, helps protect the LEDs from broken connections. Eric rigged up a servo motor to hold down the drill's trigger in a nice bit of hacking.",

I needed to use a hollow rod to take the wires down to the LED strips. The hollow rod I got from Amazon was imprecisely manufactured, and I shaved down the entire surface of the rod with a Dremel so that it would fit inside the bearings.",
